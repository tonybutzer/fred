# Case Study Fred

## Fred's Science Project HERE:

1. what discipline
2. Inputs and Outputs
3. Current Data Wangling and Storage Strategy
4. Org Chart
5. Staffing Skill Mix.
6.


## Purpose
- Allow Fred Irani to make an informed decision on Pangeo versus ARC

## Goals

- Make the transition to the cloud and pangeo easier
- Learn from the success of the HPC program
- continue to test open source solutions
- transition science outreach functions from engineering to User Services
- Tune our training strategies to deal with the rapid change phenomena
- Tune our training approaches to cater to the NEW Pangeo client

## Approach

- Jump in and immerse the scientist 
- be there to address any questions and knock down barriers
- always be moving fast
- partner with just the right and right number of people - make connections
	- example use the Evapo CHS Custom Account to augment Fred's work
- harvest github, crowd sourcing and other examples


## Project Team

- Fred Irani
- Stephanie Kagone
- Rich Signell
- Thomas Tiegen
- Tony Butzer
- other SME on-demand


## Initial Objectives

1. Evaluate Fred's science case as a pilot
2. If reasonable -- then try to fast-track Fred into the cloud
3. Improve Pangeo Awareness in USGS-EROS User Services Outreach
4. Get feedback on what an effective training and transition plan is for general science migration to the cloud from sub-optimal windows systems



## Technology Assessment

- Linux
- Jupyter
- Python
- Pangeo Gems


## Data Assessment

### Data Inputs

- Landsat?
- Sentinel?
- HLS?
- Climate Data
- Soils Data
- Land characterization data?
- NDVI
- Derived products data - i.e - ETA

### Sample Data 
- any data in netcdf format?
- any tif data?


## Data Wrangling Strategy

- caldera?


## Self directed Training

[https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro)

- Ryan Abernathy Vision of Pangeo Cult Indoctrination Training
- Ryans practical Pangeo Jupyter Book
- Tony's class on case studies at EROS


## The BIG PANGEO access

CHS Sevices link hereo



## Progress So far

- Rich is building a vesatile cloud environment
- 25 CHS employees
- Thomas Tiegen - self study on Pangeo
- The open source community and data cube communities have a nice model in Xarray
- Scientists are dictching their Arc tools for open source to run anywhere and everywhere - much better turn-arounds
- Scientists don't want to wait for provsionaing of resources - when the cloud is available



## Next Steps

1. get fred access to the Pangeo
2. get Fred access to the chs custom env
3. Identify the training areas for Fred and his team



## Notes

- need a .nojekyll file in docs directory for github to not mess with themes
